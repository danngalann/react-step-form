# React Material UI multi-step form
This is a simple multi-step form made with React and Material UI for learning purposes. It's mainly based on a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/zT62eVxShsY) by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA), but using a newer version of Material UI and structuring the code in a cleaner way. Demo [here](https://react-step-form.neocities.org).

## What I've learned
In this project I've learn to
* Use Material UI with React
* Use styling with Material UI
* Dive into the docs (a lot)
